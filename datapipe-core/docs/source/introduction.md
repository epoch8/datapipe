# Introduction to Datapipe

Datapipe, an open-source Python library, offers a solution for real-time, incremental ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes with a unique feature of record-level dependency tracking. Designed for crafting data processing pipelines, Datapipe excels in tracking dependencies for each record, ensuring that only modified data is processed, which significantly enhances data handling efficiency.

The primary Datapipe repository is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/epoch8/datapipe. 
A repository dedicated to practical examples can be found at https://github.com/epoch8/datapipe-examples/.

This documentation is beneficial for those familiar with Python 3.8 or later. Knowledge of Sqlalchemy 1.4 or 2.0 is also recommended for a comprehensive understanding of Datapipe's functionalities.

We also recommend using Poetry (https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management.
